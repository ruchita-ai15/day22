    <p>All of Us Are Dead is a South Korean zombie‑apocalypse thriller on Netflix that follows a group of high school students as they struggle to survive a sudden and brutal zombie outbreak at Hyosan High School. The original season became a global hit, known for its intense action, strong emotional bonds, and harrowing survival story. Season 2 continues the story years after the first outbreak, shifting focus from the school to a larger world now under threat as the infection spreads and new dangers emerge.

As more people are drawn into the chaos, both familiar survivors and new faces are forced into a desperate fight for their lives in an even bigger battle against the expanding zombie menace.</p>
