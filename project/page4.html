    <p>Sweet Home is a South Korean apocalyptic horror‑thriller series on Netflix, based on a popular webtoon about a world where ordinary people start turning into savage monsters driven by their deepest desires, plunging society into chaos and terror. The story centers on Cha Hyun‑su, a troubled teenager who moves into the run‑down Green Home apartment complex after a family tragedy, only to witness horrifying transformations and the collapse of normal life around him. As humans around the world become monsters, Hyun‑su and a group of fellow residents—including fighters, thinkers, and survivors—must band together to fight for survival, protect each other, and uncover the mysteries behind the outbreak. The series explores themes of humanity, fear, survival, and hope in the face of relentless danger, blending intense action and emotional character struggles across three seasons. It stars Song Kang, Lee Jin‑wook, Lee Si‑young, and others who portray determined survivors in this grim and thrilling battle against monstrous forces.</p>
